Mobile devices, integral in our digital era, heavily rely on camera functionality for a wide range of applications, from social media to augmented reality. Yet, a key challenge is enabling these typically single-camera devices to comprehend and interact with their environment in real time. Monocular Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical solution, overcoming the depth perception and scale ambiguity issues inherent in monocular vision, unlike the easier depth inference in binocular vision. In my research, I examine the ORB-SLAM approach, showcasing its effectiveness for Monocular Visual SLAM in enhancing mobile camera applications, essential for applications like augmented reality and navigation in environments around us.
