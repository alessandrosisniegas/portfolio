During the two-day Stanford University hackathon, I developed Spottr, a Python app that transforms the way we find parking by utilizing image processing techniques. Focused on sustainability and health, this project addresses the environmental impact of prolonged parking searches. I incorporated adaptive thresholding, Gaussian blur, and dilation in my design to accurately detect real-time parking spot occupancy. By optimizing the image processing pipeline with OpenCV, I significantly enhanced Spottr's speed and usability. My efforts were not only aimed at simplifying parking but also at contributing to a greener, healthier, more efficient urban environment.
